# Very-Simple-Neuron-Network
This code represents a simple neural network with three input nodes and three corresponding weight values. 
The neural network calculates the output by multiplying each input node with its corresponding weight, summing up the results, and then adding a bias value.

This code demonstrates a simple example of how a neural network can calculate its output using input nodes, corresponding weights, 
and a bias term. The output value represents the result of the neural network's computation for the given input and weight values.
