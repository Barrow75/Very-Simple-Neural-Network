# Very-Simple-Neural-Network
This code represents a simple neural network with three input nodes and three corresponding weight values. 
The neural network calculates the output by multiplying each input node with its corresponding weight, summing up the results, and then adding a bias value.

This code demonstrates a simple example of how a neural network can calculate its output using input nodes, corresponding weights, 
and a bias term. The output value represents the result of the neural network's computation for the given input and weight values.

- Inputs in Neural Networks
    - Inputs in a neural network are the information and data that the neural network recieves to to perform a task on.
          Examples: Make predictions, Image Recognition, Calculations etc

- Weights in Neural Networks
    - Weights in neural network determine the importance of each input in influencing the final output. They operate
      by finding the correlation between the inputs to help get the best output.
    - Every neuron has its own unique weight

- Bias in Neural Networks
    - Allows the neural network to fit more complex relationships between inputs and outputs. In other words helps
      provide a degree of freedom for the model to fine tune the predictions and get a better overall performance
    - Every neuron has its one bias. Not bias per weight
